# Work-Day-Scheduler

---

* The purpose of this repository is to create a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of an average 9 to 5 work day.

* When you open the planner, you can see the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

* You can also scroll down to see the timeblocks for standard business hours.

* Each of the timeblocks for the current day is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

* Click inside of the timeblock and enter an event in that specific section.

* After the event has been entered, you can then click the save button for that timeblock, and the event is saved in local storage.

* Whenever you reflresh the page, your event is still listed in the timeblock, until you change the information or clear the timeblock.

* A date utility library, was used to work with date and time at the top of the page.

* This homework will satisfy each of the acceptance criterias that are given.
